          Hi, I'm <span className="font-bold">Erick Cestari</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
        <span className="ml-4"></span>My coding journey began in 2020, and I now proudly serve as a FullStack developer. Initially, I was captivated by game development, delving into GML and Game Maker Studio 2. However, my path eventually led me to the enchanting of web development, where I discovered a new world.
          Today, I'm dedicated to honing my skills in algorithms and exploring new languages such as Rust and Go.
